# Variables


Variables are the backbone of pyees. A variable has a value, a unit and an uncertanty. The value and the uncertanty can be either a float or an array. However they have to have the same size. The unit is a string.

```
var = variable(val: float | list | ndarray, unit: str|None, uncert=None: float | list | ndarray | None)
```


## Printing
The uncertanty is printed with one significant digit. The measurement is printed with the same number of decimal places as the uncertanty. This means that if the uncertanty is a factor of 10 larger than the measurement, then the variable is printed as zero.

```
print(variable(12.3,'m',0.01))
>> 12.30 +/- 0.01 [m]

print(variable(12.34,'m',0.))
>> 12.3 +/- 0.1 [m]

print(variable(1234,'m',16))
>> 1230 +/- 20 [m]

print(variable(12.34,'m',16))
>> 10 +/- 20 [m]

print(variable(1.234,'m',16))
>> 0 +/- 20 [m]
```


## Operators
The variable object supports the following operators
```
a = variable(1)
b = variable(1)

a + b
a - b
a * b
a / b
a ** b
max(a)
min(a)
abs(a)
a < b
a <= b
a > b
a >= b
a == b
a != b
numpy.sqrt(a)
numpy.exp(a)
numpy.log(a)
numpy.log10(a)
numpy.sin(a)
numpy.cos(a)
numpy.tan(a)
numpy.mean(a), numpy.mean([a,b])
numpy.min(a), numpy.min([a,b])
numpy.max(a), numpy.max([a,b])
a[0]
```



## Units
The unit is a string.The denominator and the numerator of the unit is seperated using a dash (/). The units in the denominator or numerator are sperated using a hyphen (-). All spaces are removed from the unit string.

The following units are known:
 - unitless: 1, '', %, None
 - force: N
 - mass: g
 - Energy: J
 - power: W
 - pressure: Pa, bar
 - Temperature: K, C, F
 - Temperature difference: DELTAK, DELTAC, DELTAF
 - time: s, min, h, yr
 - volume: m3, L
 - length: m, ly, Ã…
 - current: A
 - Voltage: V
 - Angles: rad, deg
 - Resistance: ohm
 - kinematic viscosity: St


The following prefixes are known:
 - T: 1e12
 - G: 1e9
 - M: 1e6
 - k: 1e3
 - h: 1e2
 - da: 1e1
 - d: 1e-1
 - c: 1e-2
 - m: 1e-3
 - mu: 1e-6
 - n: 1e-9
 - p: 1e-12

The unit is used to determine which computations can be performed:
 - Two variables can be added together or subtracted from each other if their units are identical
 - Any two units can be multiplied or divided
 - Exponents cannot have any units
 - A variable with a unit can be raised to an integer power
 - The n'th root of a variable can be taken if the exponent of the unit of the variable is divisible by n


## Conversion of units
A variable can be converted in to any other unit with the same SI base unit using the convert-method

```
a = variable(10,'L/min')
a.convert('m3/h')
>> 0.6 [m3/h]
```


## exponents
The exponent will always apply to the unit AND the prefix. The unit 'mm3' is interpreted as "cubic millimeters" (0.001 [m] * 0.001 [m] * 0.001 [m]) and not "milli cubicmeters" (0.001 * (1 [m] * 1 [m] * 1 [m])). 

Furhtermore, 1 kilometer multiplied with 1 meter returns 1 kilometer-meter. This is beacuse there is not prefix, x, in the known prefixes, such that 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\left(xm\right)^2 \quad \rightarrow \quad x^2 = 1000 \quad \rightarrow \quad x = 31.62">. However, the result, 1 kilometer-meter, can be converted in to square meters using the convert method.



## Uncertanty propagation

If a parameter 'c' is calculated from two parameters: 'a' and 'b', then the uncertanty of 'c' depends on the uncertanty of 'a' and 'b' in the following way.

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\sigma_C = \sqrt{  \left(\frac{\partial C}{\partial A} \sigma_A\right)^2 %2B \left(\frac{\partial C}{\partial B} \sigma_B\right)^2 %2B 2\frac{\partial C}{\partial A}\frac{\partial C}{\partial B}\sigma_{AB}}">

Here <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\sigma_{AB}"> is the covariance of the measurements of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=A"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=B">.

When using variables from pyees these calculations happen automatically.
