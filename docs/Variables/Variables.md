# Variables


Variables are the backbone of pyees. A variable has a value, a unit and an uncertanty. The value and the uncertanty can be either a float or an array. However they have to have the same size. The unit is a string.

```
var = variable(val: float | list | ndarray, unit: str|None, uncert=None: float | list | ndarray | None)
```


## Printing
The uncertanty is printed with one significant digit. The measurement is printed with the same number of decimal places as the uncertanty. This means that if the uncertanty is a factor of 10 larger than the measurement, then the variable is printed as zero.

```
print(variable(12.3,'m',0.01))
>> 12.30 +/- 0.01 [m]

print(variable(12.34,'m',0.1))
>> 12.3 +/- 0.1 [m]

print(variable(1234,'m',16))
>> 1230 +/- 20 [m]

print(variable(12.34,'m',16))
>> 10 +/- 20 [m]

print(variable(1.234,'m',16))
>> 0 +/- 20 [m]
```


## Operators
The variable object supports the following operators
```
a = variable(1)
b = variable(1)

a + b
a - b
a * b
a / b
a ** b
max(a)
min(a)
abs(a)
a < b
a <= b
a > b
a >= b
a == b
a != b
numpy.sqrt(a)
numpy.exp(a)
numpy.log(a)
numpy.log10(a)
numpy.sin(a)
numpy.cos(a)
numpy.tan(a)
numpy.mean(a), numpy.mean([a,b])
numpy.min(a), numpy.min([a,b])
numpy.max(a), numpy.max([a,b])
```




## Conversion of the variable
A variable can be converted in to any other unit with the same SI base unit using the convert-method

```
a = variable(10,'L/min')
a.convert('m3/h')
>> 0.6 [m3/h]
```



## Uncertanty propagation

If a parameter 'c' is calculated from two parameters: 'a' and 'b', then the uncertanty of 'c' depends on the uncertanty of 'a' and 'b' in the following way.

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\sigma_C = \sqrt{  \left(\frac{\partial C}{\partial A} \sigma_A\right)^2 %2B \left(\frac{\partial C}{\partial B} \sigma_B\right)^2 %2B 2\frac{\partial C}{\partial A}\frac{\partial C}{\partial B}\sigma_{AB}}">

Here <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\sigma_{AB}"> is the covariance of the measurements of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=A"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=B">.

When using variables from pyees these calculations happen automatically.

## scalar variables vs array variables
The return type is either "scalarVariable" or "arrayVariable" when initializing a variable. This depends on the supplied value is a list-like object or not. The arrayVariable is basically a list which holds scalarVariables. 

The array variable also includes some array methods:
```
a = variable([1,2,3], 'm')

a[0]
>> 1 [m]

len(a)
>> 3

a[2] = variable(5, 'm')
print(a)
>> [1,2,5] [m]

a.pop(1)
print(a)
>> [1,5] [m]
```
