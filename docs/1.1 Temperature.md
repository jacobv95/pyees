# Temperature

The units celsius and fahrenheit are relative units. 20°C implies a temperature 20 kelvin above the freezing point of water (273.15K). This is taken very littearly. Therefore two types of temeprature units are included:
 - Temperature: K, C, F
 - Temperature difference: DELTAK, DELTAC, DELTAF


## addition
When two temperatures are added, their offsets will be included twice.

```
a = variable(20,'C')
b = variable(20,'C')
c = a + b
# 20°C + 20°C = (273.15 K + 20 K) + (273.15 K + 20 K) = 586.3 K = 313.15°C
print(c)
>> 313 [C]
```

When a temperature and a temperature difference is added, the offset will only be included once

```
a = variable(20,'C')
b = variable(20,'DELTAC')
c = a + b
# 20°C + 20DELTAC = (273.15 K + 20 K) + (20 K) = 313.15 K = 40°C

print(c)
>> 40 [C]
```

## subtraction
A temperature difference is returned when ever two temperatures are subtracted

```
a = variable(40,'C')
b = variable(20,'C')
c = a - b
# 40°C - 20°C = (273.15K + 40K) - (273.15K + 20K) = 20 DELTAK = 20 DELTAC
print(c)
>> 20 [DELTAC]
```

A temperature is returned when a temperature difference is subtracted from a temperature
```
a = variable(40,'C')
b = variable(20,'DELTAC')
c = a - b
# 40°C - 20DELTAC = (273.15K + 40K) - (20K) = 293.15 K = 20 C
print(c)
>> 20 [C]
```


## Average
A results of the behavior of temperature units is that the average of two temperatures is not intuitive.

```
t1 = variable(20,'C')
t2 = variable(30,'C')
t_avg = (t1 + t2) / 2
print(t_avg)
>> 162 [C]
```

The above example shows that the average of two temperature units does not return the expected result. The proper way is to determine the temperature difference

```
t1 = variable(20,'C')
t2 = variable(30,'C')
dt = t2 - t1
t_avg = t1 + dt / 2
print(t_avg)
>> 25 [C]
```


## Combination units
Combination units can be initialized including (absolute) temperature units. However, these will be replaced by temperature differences.

```
cp = variable(4180,'J/kg-K')
print(cp)
>> 4.18e+03 [J/-kg-DELTAK]
```
