# pyees
EES is a nice program with a lot of uses. However, the syntax is poor and the it can be quite combersome to import and export data and figures. Therefore pyees was created.


# How to install
Just run ```pip install dataUncert```

## Scope of this package
These computations quickly becomes very difficult for more complicated equations than the one used in this example. This packages is designed to easily perform such computations. Furthermore a few features is added to the packages
 - Read data with uncertanty from an .xls or .xlsx file
 - Print measurements with the correct number of significant digits based on the uncertanty
 - Plot data with errorbars
 - Perform regression where the regression constants are affected by the uncertanty of the data
 - solve n equations with n variables
 - look up material properties

## Documentation
The documentation is split to parts:
 - 1 variables
   - Temperature
 - 3 Importing data
 - 4 Fitting
 - 5 Prop
 - 6 Solving
